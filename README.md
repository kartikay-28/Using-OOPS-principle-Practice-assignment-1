# Library Management System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by implementing a simple Library Management System in JavaScript. It includes `Book` and `User` classes with functionalities for borrowing and returning books.

## Features
- Create books with details like title, author, and ISBN.
- Users can borrow available books and return them when done.
- Books track their availability status.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Run
1. Copy the `library.js` file into a JavaScript runtime (Node.js or browser console).
2. Instantiate books and users.
3. Call the `borrow` and `return` methods on user objects to simulate library operations.

## Example Output
```
Alice borrowed The Great Gatsby.
The Great Gatsby is not available.
Alice returned The Great Gatsby.
Bob borrowed The Great Gatsby.
```

## Files Included
- `library.js` â†’ Contains the code implementation.
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation.
- `output.txt` â†’ Logs of borrowing and returning books.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
